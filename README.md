## Purpose

Motivation: 

* Enable governments and third-parties to make informed decisions about road infrastructure changes
* Visually depict how specific decisions affect the status quo
* Create a consistent way to test new proposed changes and evaluate them


## Scope

Application that does a simple simulation for building a new road given a set of pre-existing roads and their respective loads.

Simulating actual road structures in specific regions, ability to create your own enviroment by inserting new nodes and their respecive load/traffic. 

## Next steps...
