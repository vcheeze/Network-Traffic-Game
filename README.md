# Network Traffic: A Game
TED Final Project

## Purpose

Motivation: 

* Enable governments and third-parties to make informed decisions about road infrastructure changes
* Visually depict how specific decisions affect the status quo
* Create a consistent way to test new proposed changes and evaluate them


## Scope

Application that does a simple simulation for building a new road given a set of pre-existing roads and their respective loads.

Simulating actual road structures in specific regions, ability to create your own enviroment by inserting new nodes and their respecive load/traffic. 

## Next steps...

1. User Experience
2. Interface
3. Motivations of the project
4. Goals of the project
5. More specific scope of the project



Hayat: design user interface

Theo: research on algorithm for traffic simulation

Peter: develop basic backend ideas
